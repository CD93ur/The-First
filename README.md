# hello-world

Hi!  I'm Caleb.  I'm currently working as an ALT (assistant language teacher) in Japan. 

I've decided to start learning web development to further diversify my resume and make myself for hireable (hopefully).
I've got an idea for an app that I think would be really cool, but who doesn't these days? Haha.
